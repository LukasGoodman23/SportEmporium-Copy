To travel to our Basketball game: In order to travel to this game, move to the far left from the Baseball car, and Tennis Court. You will see a sign pointing you in the right direction.

Homerun Derby Directions: 
The objective of this game is simple, hit homeruns.

You are able to do this by picking up the baseball bat, and swinging at the baseball on the tee. There are 2
scoring areas marked on the scoreboard. Far and Close homeruns depending on the homerun. To travel back to the hub, click the red button in the back of the fence.

IMPORTANT: Do not swing too fast at the baseball, this causes the bat to miss the baseball, all that is needed is a 
medium speed swing on the ball. 

Basketball Directions: 
Game is simple, shoot the basketball into the basket. You can see if you score via, particle effects on the hoop. 
You can see your score update on the left of the hoop.
